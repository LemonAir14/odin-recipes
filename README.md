# odin-recipes
Hello, Im Asghar, right now I dont have a lot of computer sciene but i really want to learn and I think I will be able to do it. this is my first project in which I'm gonna make a website with some recipes, this should be pretty easy I imagine. I might make some mistakes on the html boilerplate but I think I remember all the other tags and rules for the paragraphs and links and photos and stuff. I might need to look up If i forget to do boilerplate but even if I forget its fine since I can just basically do an auto boilerplate in visual studio code with !. Lets do this!!!! p.s. I forgot all about git and I feel like it'll tough to learn about that cause I have no idea what git push or add does.
